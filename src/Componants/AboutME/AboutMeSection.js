        As an ethusiastic, ambitious and empathetic former hospitality
        professional with 15 years experience, I strive to find a stimulating
        and challenging new career opportunity in software development.

      <p>
        I am currently working as an Instructor Associate at General Assembly's
        Front-End Web Development course with my second cohort. Working closely
        with the instructor to deliver course content, my role includes
        technical troubleshooting and debugging of HTML, CSS and JS, while
        providing support and mentoring to the students.
      </p>

      <p>
        Successfully graduating from General Assemblyâ€™s (GA) Software
        Engineering Immersive course (SEI), I learned fundamental
        problem-solving skill sets and fluency in multiple frameworks and
        stacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being a former Bar Manager/Gaming Supervisor, I have gained extensive
        experience working with and leading a small team of staff as well as
        fundamental skills related to public relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to find a role where I can collaborate with others, grow my
        skills, and contribute to highly functional and uniquely designed
        products.
