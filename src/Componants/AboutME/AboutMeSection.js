      <p>
        As an enthusiastic, ambitious and epenthetic former hospitality
        professional with 15 years experience, I strive to find a stimulating
        and challenging new career opportunity in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hospitality is a fast-paced working environment at times and adapting
        quickly to changing priorities is critical. Switching between different
        areas of the business is a must and over my career I have gained the
        ability to problem solve on the fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a former Bar Manager/Gaming Supervisor, I have gained extensive
        experience working with and leading a small team of staff as well as
        fundamental skills related to public relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to find a role where I can collaborate with others, grow my
        skills, and contribute to highly functional and uniqued designed
        products.
